## Documentation

Visit the IndyKite One Developer Community site for official
[IndyKite documentation](https://indykite.one/blog?category=5e3e9297-3451-4b52-91ee-8027dcd1789c)
and to find out how to use the entire platform for your project.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Go 1.19
* AppAgent credentials and Service account credentials. These are obtained when setting up the Admin Console. 

### Install

```go
go get -u github.com/indykite/jarvis-sdk-go
```

### Configure the development environment
You need to have a configuration JSON file (AppAgent credentials or Service account credentials) to be able to use the Jarvis Proto SDK.
Example configuration file:

```json
{
  "appSpaceId": "696e6479-6b69-4465-8000-010100000002",
  "baseUrl": "https://jarvis.indykite.com",
  "applicationId": "696e6479-6b69-4465-8000-020100000002",
  "defaultTenantId": "696e6479-6b69-4465-8000-030100000002",
  "appAgentId": "696e6479-6b69-4465-8000-050100000002",
  "endpoint": "jarvis.indykite.com",
  "privateKeyJWK": {
    "kty": "EC",
    "d": "aa",
    "use": "sig",
    "crv": "P-256",
    "kid": "2e5lIxxb6obIwpok",
    "x": "6d83se2Eg",
    "y": "lshzMo",
    "alg": "ES256"
  },
  "privateKeyPKCS8Base64": "LS0tLS==",
  "privateKeyPKCS8": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nM\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
}
```

Conditionally optional parameters:

- baseUrl
- defaultTenantId
- endpoint

There are two ways to set up the necessary credentials. You either pass the JSON configuration file (AppAgent credentials or Service account credentials) to the `INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable or set the `INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable to the configuration file's path.

   1. on Linux and OSX

      ```shell
      export INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='{"appSpaceId":"00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000000","appAgentId":"00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000001","endpoint": "application.indykite.com","privateKeyJWK":{"kty":"EC","d": "abcdef","use": "sig","crv": "P-256","kid":"efghij","x":"klmnop","y":"qrstvw","alg":"ES256"}}'`
      ```

      or

      ```shell
      export INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/Users/xx/configuration.json
      ```

   1. on Windows command line

      ```shell
      setex INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='{"appSpaceId":"00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000000","appAgentId":"00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000001","endpoint": "application.indykite.com","privateKeyJWK":{"kty":"EC","d": "abcdef","use": "sig","crv": "P-256","kid":"efghij","x":"klmnop","y":"qrstvw","alg":"ES256"}}'`
      ```

      or

      ```shell
      setex INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE "C:\Users\xx\Documents\configuration.json"
      ```
